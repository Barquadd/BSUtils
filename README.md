# BSUtils
Simple GUI Application that can speed up doing some simple tasks for Beat Saber.
# The Buttons and What They Do #
#### Disable ASW ####
This disables oculus' "Asynchronous Spacewarp" (ASW), usually, ASW doesn't cause any issues, but in Beat Saber, sometimes when you start a map, the game will drop frames and will not regain them until it hits 90 fps, which would usually be fine, but ASW keeps the game at 45 until it hits 90. Pressing it will simply turn it off, if you're a steamvr user, you will not need this.
#### Change BS Priority ####
This simply sets Beat Saber's task priority to High.

Please don't expect a lot from this, I'm making this just as something to do in my free time. Please don't expect this to be some miracle fix.
